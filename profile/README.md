**Vertex** is a publishing platform dedicated to bringing together high-quality Firefox mods in one unified space.  

Unlike a mod manager, Vertex serves as a **curation and collaboration hub**. Our purpose is to showcase outstanding work, provide visibility for creators, and offer users a reliable source for discovering and following the best mods available.  

Vertex complements tools such as **Sine** (a widely used mod manager) rather than replacing them. By centralizing discovery and fostering community, we aim to ensure that quality projects receive the attention they deserve.
